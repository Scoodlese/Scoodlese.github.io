                            The Black-bellied Whistling-Duck is a boisterous 
                            duck with a brilliant pink bill and an unusual,
                            long-legged silhouette. In places like Texas and Louisiana, 
                            watch for noisy flocks of these gaudy ducks dropping into 
                            fields to forage on seeds, or loafing on golf course ponds. 
                            Listen for them, these ducks really do have a whistle 
                            for their call.

                            The Crested is a breed of domestic duck, characterised by a crest or 
                            tuft of feathers on the head. These are mostly kept for pets.

                            Small, subtly beautiful, gray-brown duck

                            prominent shaggy crest. In flight looks pallid, 
                            with whitish underwings, pale secondaries, and

                            freshwater or brackish wetlands with abundant emergent
