                A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom,[1] is the 
                reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
                (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers
                 consist of a combination of vegetative organs
                 sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. 
                 Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that 
                 produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants 
                 produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which 
                 produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains 
                 produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes 
                 are contained within the ovules produced in the 
                 ovary.[2][3] In some plants, multiple flowers occur 
                 singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), and some are
                  arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle
                   (inflorescence stalk).[2]
